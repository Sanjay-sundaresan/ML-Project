# ML-Project
An empirical study of the relationship between imbalance and overlapping in datasets, and the problems caused by both imbalance and overlapping occurring simultaneously.

Decision Tree, SVM and KNN classifiers are used on 9 different datasets with varying degrees of imbalance and overlapping, and the performance is compared. 

Solutions are explored to address the issues of imbalance and overlapping
